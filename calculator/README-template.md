##CHALLENGES:
Arguably one of the more challenging projects that I have come across. During this project, I can honestly say that I learned so much. However, I still feel that I have much more to learn. It was a challenging project that I had to break down into many steps. Some may call it mini-problems. Here are a few of the many obstacles that I encountered:

<b>1.</b> Event Listening

	-I had to distinguish button presses for numbers before and after a user presses an operator.

	-Ongoing operating on existing calculations.

<b>2.</b> Data Accessing

	-Variables had to be set up in specific ways for the numbers to be stored and reused continuously.

<b>3.</b> SASS

	-This is only my second project incorporating sass. So the main obstacle was still learning the syntax and using more of it.

	-Theme switching used three different color sets.

	-The way that I set the semantics in HTML was crucial to allow for better designing and easier styling(classes, id)

## USEFUL RESOURCES:
There are many ways to complete a calculator. But here are a few of the articles that I used that helped me with this project:

	https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/dataset

	-One of the new things I learned in this project was datasets and how you can give them a custom name based on what you want to save. They come in handy when you want to save data in HTML but hide it from the visual side of the front-end experience.

	https://gomakethings.com/converting-strings-to-numbers-with-vanilla-javascript/

	-Since the text rendered to the user will be a string, the data accessed in javascript is also a string. Computation in string form will concatenate the strings. So this article showed me how to convert to numbers for math use.

##NOTES:
It is still a work in progress. Things to add:

	-Event Listening for typing both numbers and operators

	-Better user experience
