## My Process
### Built With:
- HTML
- Sass
- Javascript
  - Class based architecture
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

As part of my fundamental approach for re-learning javascript and its fundamentals, this project allowed to re implement my knowledge of classes and its methods.

Classes in Javascript remind me of mixins in Sass. So i can say that my knowledge of both, mixins and classes improved along with knowing what null in javascript truly means. 

Null can be seen as a placeholder. It is not necessarily needed but can be used if necessary. Moreover, it can also be a placeholder for something within an object that has yet to be decided.
