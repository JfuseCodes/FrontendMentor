## CHALLENGES:
My biggest challenge for this project came with getting the numbers right within javascript. Here are the obstacles i came across while working on this project:

1.In general I had a hard time storing the values of each section
  -Ex: the input numbers within bill, or the clicked button of the tip %

2.In addition to the storage of values, my next obstacle was making the resulting tip amount and totals more interactive
  -with changes to the inputs, the results change based on what inputs were changed. Afterall that is the magic that javascript brings.
 -Ex: if i already have my results, with the change from a button % i can simply type in my desired custom tip amount, and automatically the results will change without having to update or re-input any other values.

## USEFUL RESOURCES:
Here are obstacles i overcame along with the articles and/or websites i used to help me not only learn more but gain muscle memory for my problem solving skills:

  -https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/currentTarget
   -This article about currentTarget in DOM manipulation was useful for the toggling of buttons and also allowing for only button to toggle at a time.
  -https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/change_event
   -an article about the "change" event which provided me the knowledge i needed for the interactiveness i was seeking in terms of the results updating on the change of input values.
  -https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/
    - a tutorial guide for the grid CSS layout system that i had to take retake mess around with as a refresher
  -https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/forms/validation/
    - bootstrap validation to make sure that the right values are submitted for the desired results.

  -https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties
   -an article on CSS VARIABLES: this is my first time that i incorporated css variables in to a project.
   -It really helped cleanup my code by not having so much numeric values as far as the hex codes and RGB color schemes go.
