## CHALLENGES:
This is my first project where i have incorporated Sass. My biggest challenge was setting up sass for the project and understanding its differences.

## USEFUL RESOURCES:
For learning sass i used the main documentation from its website. I mainly used its variable system and media query breakpoints. I can say that i am comfortable in using them in future projects. Furthermore i  would definitely like to use other aspects of sass as well.

   -The variables in sass begin with the $ symbol. I used them to make my scss code cleaner and to also remember better the primary colors better.

  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/email

  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions

   -These 3 articles allowed me to fully incorporate validation for the email input.

   First article gives an overview on the input element within the HTML file.

   The second article goes into more details about the email input and how it automatically can check whether the input has the form of an email. However it is not too strict of an validator.

   Lastly, the final article goes over the implementation for validations via javascript code.
