## CHALLENGES:

My biggest challenge in this project came from designing and styling the game. But I will credit this project tremendously for improving my knowledge of SASS. Although I still have so much more to learn from SASS, I can confidently say that I know SASS. Here are a few of the styling problems that I came across:

<b>1.</b> Positioning and Inset

	-I've come across this problem in one of my projects before, but I wanted a way to find a set position for each game choice while also combining it with responsiveness in different screen sizes.

	-Ongoing operating on existing calculations.

<b>2.</b> Responsive Designing

	-This is my most responsive project yet, with a mobile-first design. It's where I spent the majority of my time on this project. Of course, SASS made it easier to make it more responsive, but it came with a learning crutch since I was still new to SASS.

## USEFUL RESOURCES:
To learn more about SASS, I read a book to make things click for me. So much so that it inspired me to start a blog to encourage people to pick up SASS(among many other things).

The book's name is [Pragmatic Guide to Sass 3: Tame the Modern Style Sheet](https://pragprog.com/titles/pg_sass3/pragmatic-guide-to-sass-3/). I highly recommend it because it is an easy read and very thorough with its explanations for different use cases of SASS.

	-[Browser Local Storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) - I learned about saving variables or values to the browser's local storage. So even when the web page refreshes or the browser shuts down, whatever was stored to the variable the last time the page was open will remain there. Local storage proved to help score the game.
