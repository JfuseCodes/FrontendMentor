## CHALLENGES:
Besides more media queries and making the project responsive to many different
screen sizes, my biggest challenge was the image given in this project.
The original color of the image was black and white, and the goal was to make it purple like in the images above.


## USEFUL RESOURCES:
These are the websites i used that proved to be very helpful in the development of this card:
