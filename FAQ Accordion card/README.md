## CHALLENGES:
Besides more media queries and making the project responsive to many different
screen sizes, I had two other big challenges.

1.Incorporating the javascript.
2.The Image overlay at the top was difficult because it needed a certain structure within the HTML in addition to multiple div tags in order to get the layering to work. Overall im proud of the way that it came out.

## USEFUL RESOURCES:
These are the websites i used that proved to be very helpful in the development of this card:

  -https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_toggle_class.asp
    - this website assisted me with the javascript where i learned to toggle an elements class. In other words remove and add the class based on whether the toggle is false or true.

  -https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp
   -same website as before but different article which helped me to  relearn and apply the positioning fundamentals for the image challenge that i came across.
